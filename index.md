Hi! Welcome to my ~~mancave~~ blog site! This is where I plan to put long-form posts in, so that I wouldn't clog up the Twitter feed of my followers or something. Trust me, only a *handful* of people can handle my yapping.

Contents include:
- Nerd stuff
- Ramblings
- Programming, and all the pains associated.
- Blog posts spontaneously disappearing (`git push --force` my beloved).
- Inconsistent writing style which may or may not be influenced by my mental state.
- Even more ramblings and yapping.

This site will probably be updated a lot because I'm new to using Jekyll with GitHub pages, and previewing changes locally with Jekyll is an absolute *fucking nightmare* because Ruby:tm:. Don't worry, though! You won't even know there's an update because I'd probably drop a commit or two before you even realize what's doing on.
