If you arrived here after encountering a 404 page trying to visit this blog, congrats! You're one of the, uh... *0* OGs now. You might also noticed the name change from simply "Atirut's Blog" to "The Code Cave". Name is still a WIP, but it's part of the rebrand. I probably won't make a second announcement if I change the name again, so don't be confused when it happens.

The reason for the 404 page? I "promoted" this site from a repository GH Pages to a user GH Pages, so it now lives at `atirut-w.github.io` instead of `atirut-w.github.io/blog`. Sorry about rendering your one or two bookmarks useless, by the way.

Also, I've got a few things planned for this site...
- A new, custom theme. The [Hacker theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) is nice, but I kinda want something slightly different. I have a feeling the redesign branch will live for at least a month (totally not foreshadowing).
- RSS feed, because convenience.
- Redo the homepage, or at least rearrange it to make more sense. and...
- add more stuff to the homepage, and maybe split the listing for blog posts into a separate page.

This site is turning from a blog into an inconsistent diary, isn't it? Well, I'll be implementing said changes in the next few days (minus the redesign, my CSS sucks), so watch out for that.
