Hi everyone, I'm still alive! It's only been... uh... crap, that's two months away from being a year worth of absence. Well, as you guys can see, I've done some renovations to the site, and it looks... meh. Maybe the green-on-black color scheme wasn't a good idea.

Anyway, some stuff happened, and now I'm almost into my third year of university! But then again, I also gained a lot of dead conceptual projects that I never finished. Got some idea for writing a Godot importer for HPL3 assets and scenes, notably from SOMA, but I haven't started on it yet. I'm also having trouble keeping my notes organized, and now I have *absolutely* no idea what classes I need to sign up for the coming term. I contacted the... whatever "อาจารย์ที่ปรึกษา" is in English, about the classes, and they haven't replied yet. Sure hope they reply before this Monday...

On a more personal note, I'm now basing my operations out of a condo room! Why not at home? Because of a certain woman's ego. I swear her ego is just nasty. One upside is that it's really close to the university, so I can just walk there and get on the bus.

Annnd that's all I can think of for now. Let's nope I won't go on another hiatus again. With how well I'm improving at actually doing things on time (probably due to the fact that I don't have to deal with the *woman*'s ego), I should be able to write more blog posts. For the time being, see you guys later!
